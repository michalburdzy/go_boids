# go_boids
Golang implementation of BOIDS (Bird Droids) imitating flocking behaviour of real birds. Each boid is a separate go routine communicating with others using shared memory space protected by mutex locks

Inspired by great course ["Mastering Multithreading Programming with Go (Golang)" by James Cutajar](https://www.udemy.com/course/multithreading-in-go-lang)

# try go boids!
Run `./boids`
